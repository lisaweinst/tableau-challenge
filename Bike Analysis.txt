Analysis:

From observing all of the months with the most records. The month of August has the highest number of records compared to other months. This might be because the summer months are the most popular time to go outside and ride a bike. I believe August has the most records because it is the end of summer and individuals wants to get a ride in before the nice weather ends. 

The most popular times to start going on a biking trip is between 5 and 6pm for the Spring, Summer, and Fall. The popular time to start a trip is 8am. This might because they want to start earlier to avoid heavy snow later in the day. The summer months have the most records compared to the other months. The start time of 5 to 6pm has over 250,000 records each. 

Subscribers have the rented the highest number of bikes compared to customers. This might be because they are advertising well to loyal customers. I would try over the years to convert more regular customers to subscribers since they are doing a good job in letting subscribers know of maybe certain deals that are available.
